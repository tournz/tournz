Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br>
I am a 26 year-old full-stack web developer, graduate of web development bootcamp Le Wagon in Istanbul since March 2021, with 2 month experience as a data engineer in Python. I am actively looking for remote and contract work opportunities as Ruby on Rails or Python developer, and can also learn new stacks. My previous background is in finance and investing.<br>
